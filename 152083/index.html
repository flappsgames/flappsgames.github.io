				What is Platcore?! Well Platcore is a platformer/avoid style of gameplay, you play as a Platbot which is a testing robot for Platcore, and Platcore will be using you to test out their newest products, which come in the form of things which aren&amp;&amp;#35;8217;t exactly your friend &amp;&amp;#35;40;Lasers, turrets, even bigger lasers, and evil things!&amp;&amp;#35;41;. You play in a test chamber and your sole aim is to stay alive and survive the testing procedures, remember though, your robot is dispensable so there are MANY robots to play as if yours gets destroyed.
The games soundtrack is synced up to the Platcore AI, so when the soundtrack goes boom, something else is going boom, and it&amp;&amp;#35;8217;s likely to hit you in the face.
So this has been in development for quite a while in 2011 and has had a crazy rollercoaster ride in the development process as I ended up quitting my job mid-development so I could work full time on what I love; Giving you guys content! And then the sponsorship process was a rollercoaster in itself of a few months negotiating and falling through deals so I&amp;&amp;#35;8217;m like extactic to be able to release this. And I hope you like it as much I as did developing it!
If you chose the wrong control scheme, just reload the game and you&amp;&amp;#35;8217;ll be able to pick it again! :&amp;&amp;#35;41;
Be warned, if you skip through the tutorial &amp;&amp;#35;8211; you can&amp;&amp;#35;8217;t get it back without deleting your save file! So read!
